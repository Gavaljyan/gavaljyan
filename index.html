							<p>Many people know something about NASA’s work. But most probably have no idea about how many different things the agency does. Astronauts in orbit conduct scientific research. Satellites help scientists learn more about Earth. Space probes study the solar system and beyond. New developments improve air travel and other aspects of flight. NASA is also beginning a new program to send humans to explore the Moon and Mars. In addition to those major missions, NASA does many other things. The agency shares what it learns so that its information can make life better for people worldwide. For example, companies can use NASA discoveries to create new spinoff products.NASA helps teachers prepare students who will be the engineers, scientists, astronauts and other NASA workers of the future. They will be the adventurers who will continue exploration of the solar system and universe. NASA has a tradition of investing in programs and activities that inspire students, educators, families and communities in the excitement and discovery of exploration. NASA offers training to help teachers learn new ways to teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The agency also involves students in NASA missions to help them get excited about learning.
							NASA’s Headquarters is in Washington, D.C. The agency has nine centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and seven test and research facilities located in several states around the country. More than 17,000 people work for NASA. Many more people work with the agency as government contractors. These people are hired by companies that NASA pays to do work. The combined workforce represents a variety of jobs. Astronauts may be the best-known NASA employees, but they only represent a small number of the total workforce. Many NASA workers are scientists and engineers. But people there hold many other jobs, too, from secretaries to writers to lawyers to teachers.</p>
